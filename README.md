# synesthesia-simulator
This is an attempt to simulate pitch to color synesthesia.

Contributors:
- Vulpe Cristina;
- Vodita Stefan;
- The good people on the LabVIEW forums, by providing vis for sound frequency processing and wavelength to RGB conversion.

State of the project:

Working, but could use a filter, and some delay on the color switches. Right now, it changes color for every frequency detected.
